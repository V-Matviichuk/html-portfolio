    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <hr/>
    <ul>
        <li>Cars, Motorcycles, Bikes, etc. I'm obsessed with everything that has wheels.</li>
        <li>Cooking. Even though, I don't want to cook for a living, but I surely love cooking for myself and for my friends and family.</li>
        <li>Music. Learning to play a guitar.</li>
        <li>Videogames. I've been a gamer since the age of 8, and still one today when time allows it.</li>
        <li>Travelling. I was lucky enough to travel to the majority of European countries, North America, and plenty of Arabic states. Asia is still on the list though.</li>
    </ul>
